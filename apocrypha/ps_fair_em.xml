Amongst the which, when the music began to sound the measures, each masker made choice of his lady. And one, more forward than the rest, stepped towards thee, which I perceiving, thrust him aside and took thee myself. But this was taken in so ill part, that at my coming out of the court gate, with justling together it was my chance to be thrust into the arm. The doer thereof, because he was the original cause of the disorder at that inconvenient time, was presently committed, and is this morning sent for to answer the matter. And I think here he comes.
