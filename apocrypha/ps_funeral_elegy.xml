<subtitle>TO MASTER JOHN PETER<lb />of Bowhay in Devon, Esq.</subtitle>
<line globalnumber="1">The love I bore to your brother, and will do to his memory, hath crav'd from me this last duty of a friend; I am herein but a second to the privilege of Truth, who can warrant more in his behalf than I undertook to deliver. Exercise in this kind I will little affect, and am less addicted to, but there must be miracle in that labor which, to witness my remembrance to this departed gentleman, I would not willingly undergo. Yet whatsoever is here done, is done to him, and to him only. For whom and whose sake I will not forget to remember any friendly respects to you, or to any of those that have lov'd him for himself, and himself for his deserts.</line>

<line globalnumber="2" number="1" form="verse">Since Time, and his predestinated end,</line>
<line globalnumber="3" number="2" form="verse">Abridg&#8217;d the circuit of his hopeful days,</line>
<line globalnumber="4" number="3" form="verse">Whiles both his Youth and Virtue did intend</line>
<line globalnumber="5" number="4" form="verse">The good endeavors of deserving praise,</line>
<line globalnumber="6" number="5" form="verse">What memorable monument can last</line>
<line globalnumber="7" number="6" form="verse">Whereon to build his never-blemish&#8217;d name</line>
<line globalnumber="8" number="7" form="verse">But his own worth, wherein his life was grac&#8217;d&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="9" number="8" form="verse">Sith as [that] ever he maintain&#8217;d the same?</line>
<line globalnumber="10" number="9" form="verse">Oblivion in the darkest day to come,</line>
<line globalnumber="11" number="10" form="verse">When sin shall tread on merit in the dust,</line>
<line globalnumber="12" number="11" form="verse">Cannot rase out the lamentable tomb</line>
<line globalnumber="13" number="12" form="verse">Of his short-liv&#8217;d deserts; but still they must,</line>
<line globalnumber="14" number="13" form="verse">Even in the hearts and memories of men,</line>
<line globalnumber="15" number="14" form="verse">Claim fit Respect, that they, in every limb</line>
<line globalnumber="16" number="15" form="verse">Rememb&#8217;ring what he was, with comfort then</line>
<line globalnumber="17" number="16" form="verse">May pattern out one truly good, by him.</line>
<line globalnumber="18" number="17" form="verse">For he was truly good, if honest care</line>
<line globalnumber="19" number="18" form="verse">Of harmless conversation may commend</line>
<line globalnumber="20" number="19" form="verse">A life free from such stains as follies are,</line>
<line globalnumber="21" number="20" form="verse">Ill recompensed only in his end.</line>
<line globalnumber="22" number="21" form="verse">Nor can the tongue of him who lov&#8217;d him least</line>
<line globalnumber="23" number="22" form="verse">(If there can be minority of love</line>
<line globalnumber="24" number="23" form="verse">To one superlative above the rest</line>
<line globalnumber="25" number="24" form="verse">Of many men in steady faith) reprove</line>
<line globalnumber="26" number="25" form="verse">His constant temper, in the equal weight</line>
<line globalnumber="27" number="26" form="verse">Of thankfulness and kindness: Truth doth leave</line>
<line globalnumber="28" number="27" form="verse">Sufficient proof, he was in every right</line>
<line globalnumber="29" number="28" form="verse">As kind to give, as thankful to receive.</line>
<line globalnumber="30" number="29" form="verse">The curious eye of a quick-brain&#8217;d survey</line>
<line globalnumber="31" number="30" form="verse">Could scantly find a mote amidst the sun</line>
<line globalnumber="32" number="31" form="verse">Of his too-short&#8217;ned days, or make a prey</line>
<line globalnumber="33" number="32" form="verse">Of any faulty errors he had done&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="34" number="33" form="verse">Not that he was above the spleenful sense</line>
<line globalnumber="35" number="34" form="verse">And spite of malice, but for that he had</line>
<line globalnumber="36" number="35" form="verse">Warrant enough in his own innocence</line>
<line globalnumber="37" number="36" form="verse">Against the sting of some in nature bad.</line>
<line globalnumber="38" number="37" form="verse">Yet who is he so absolutely blest</line>
<line globalnumber="39" number="38" form="verse">That lives encompass&#8217;d in a mortal frame,</line>
<line globalnumber="40" number="39" form="verse">Sometime in reputation not oppress&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="41" number="40" form="verse">By some in nothing famous but defame?</line>
<line globalnumber="42" number="41" form="verse">Such in the By-path and the Ridgeway lurk</line>
<line globalnumber="43" number="42" form="verse">That leads to ruin, in a smooth pretense</line>
<line globalnumber="44" number="43" form="verse">Of what they do to be a special work</line>
<line globalnumber="45" number="44" form="verse">Of singleness, not tending to offense;</line>
<line globalnumber="46" number="45" form="verse">Whose very virtues are, not to detract</line>
<line globalnumber="47" number="46" form="verse">Whiles hope remains of gain (base fee of slaves),</line>
<line globalnumber="48" number="47" form="verse">Despising chiefly men in fortunes wrack&#8217;d&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="49" number="48" form="verse">But death to such gives unrememb&#8217;red graves.</line>
<line globalnumber="50" number="49" offset="2" form="verse">Now therein liv&#8217;d he happy, if to be</line>
<line globalnumber="51" number="50" offset="2" form="verse">Free from detraction happiness it be.</line>
<line globalnumber="52" number="51" form="verse">His younger years gave comfortable hope</line>
<line globalnumber="53" number="52" form="verse">To hope for comfort in his riper youth,</line>
<line globalnumber="54" number="53" form="verse">Which, harvest-like, did yield again the crop</line>
<line globalnumber="55" number="54" form="verse">Of Education, better&#8217;d in his truth.</line>
<line globalnumber="56" number="55" form="verse">Those noble twins of heaven-infused races,</line>
<line globalnumber="57" number="56" form="verse">Learning and Wit, refined in their kind</line>
<line globalnumber="58" number="57" form="verse">Did jointly both, in their peculiar graces,</line>
<line globalnumber="59" number="58" form="verse">Enrich the curious temple of his mind;</line>
<line globalnumber="60" number="59" form="verse">Indeed a temple, in whose precious white</line>
<line globalnumber="61" number="60" form="verse">Sat Reason by Religion oversway&#8217;d,</line>
<line globalnumber="62" number="61" form="verse">Teaching his other senses, with delight,</line>
<line globalnumber="63" number="62" form="verse">How Piety and Zeal should be obey&#8217;d&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="64" number="63" form="verse">Not fruitlessly in prodigal expense</line>
<line globalnumber="65" number="64" form="verse">Wasting his best of time, but so content</line>
<line globalnumber="66" number="65" form="verse">With Reason&#8217;s golden Mean to make defense</line>
<line globalnumber="67" number="66" form="verse">Against the assault of youth&#8217;s encouragement;</line>
<line globalnumber="68" number="67" form="verse">As not the tide of this surrounding age</line>
<line globalnumber="69" number="68" form="verse">(When now his father&#8217;s death had freed his will)</line>
<line globalnumber="70" number="69" form="verse">Could make him subject to the drunken rage</line>
<line globalnumber="71" number="70" form="verse">Of such whose only glory is their ill.</line>
<line globalnumber="72" number="71" form="verse">He from the happy knowledge of the wise</line>
<line globalnumber="73" number="72" form="verse">Draws virtue to reprove secured fools</line>
<line globalnumber="74" number="73" form="verse">And shuns the glad sleights of ensnaring vice</line>
<line globalnumber="75" number="74" form="verse">To spend his spring of days in sacred schools.</line>
<line globalnumber="76" number="75" form="verse">Here gave he diet to the sick desires</line>
<line globalnumber="77" number="76" form="verse">That day by day assault the weaker man,</line>
<line globalnumber="78" number="77" form="verse">And with fit moderation still retires</line>
<line globalnumber="79" number="78" form="verse">From what doth batter virtue now and then.</line>
<line globalnumber="80" number="79" form="verse">But that I not intend in full discourse</line>
<line globalnumber="81" number="80" form="verse">To progress out his life, I could display</line>
<line globalnumber="82" number="81" form="verse">A good man in each part exact and force</line>
<line globalnumber="83" number="82" form="verse">The common voice to warrant what I say.</line>
<line globalnumber="84" number="83" form="verse">For if his fate and heaven had decreed</line>
<line globalnumber="85" number="84" form="verse">That full of days he might have liv&#8217;d to see</line>
<line globalnumber="86" number="85" form="verse">The grave in peace, the times that should succeed</line>
<line globalnumber="87" number="86" form="verse">Had been best-speaking witnesses with me;</line>
<line globalnumber="88" number="87" form="verse">Whose conversation so untouch&#8217;d did move</line>
<line globalnumber="89" number="88" form="verse">Respect most in itself, as who would scan</line>
<line globalnumber="90" number="89" form="verse">His honesty and worth, by them might prove</line>
<line globalnumber="91" number="90" form="verse">He was a kind, true, perfect gentleman&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="92" number="91" form="verse">Not in the outside of disgraceful folly,</line>
<line globalnumber="93" number="92" form="verse">Courting opinion with unfit disguise,</line>
<line globalnumber="94" number="93" form="verse">Affecting fashions, nor addicted wholly</line>
<line globalnumber="95" number="94" form="verse">To unbeseeming blushless vanities,</line>
<line globalnumber="96" number="95" offset="2" form="verse">But suiting so his habit and desire</line>
<line globalnumber="97" number="96" offset="2" form="verse">As that his Virtue was his best Attire.</line>
<line globalnumber="98" number="97" form="verse">Not in the waste of many idle words</line>
<line globalnumber="99" number="98" form="verse">Car&#8217;d he to be heard talk, nor in the float</line>
<line globalnumber="100" number="99" form="verse">Of fond conceit, such as this age affords,</line>
<line globalnumber="101" number="100" form="verse">By vain discourse upon himself to dote;</line>
<line globalnumber="102" number="101" form="verse">For his becoming silence gave such grace</line>
<line globalnumber="103" number="102" form="verse">To his judicious parts, as what he spake</line>
<line globalnumber="104" number="103" form="verse">Seem&#8217;d rather answers which the wise embrace</line>
<line globalnumber="105" number="104" form="verse">Than busy questions such as talkers make.</line>
<line globalnumber="106" number="105" form="verse">And though his qualities might well deserve</line>
<line globalnumber="107" number="106" form="verse">Just commendation, yet his furnish&#8217;d mind</line>
<line globalnumber="108" number="107" form="verse">Such harmony of goodness did preserve</line>
<line globalnumber="109" number="108" form="verse">As nature never built in better kind;</line>
<line globalnumber="110" number="109" form="verse">Knowing the best, and therefore not presuming</line>
<line globalnumber="111" number="110" form="verse">In knowing, but for that it was the best,</line>
<line globalnumber="112" number="111" form="verse">Ever within himself free choice resuming</line>
<line globalnumber="113" number="112" form="verse">Of true perfection, in a perfect breast;</line>
<line globalnumber="114" number="113" form="verse">So that his mind and body made an inn,</line>
<line globalnumber="115" number="114" form="verse">The one to lodge the other, both like fram&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="116" number="115" form="verse">For fair conditions, guests that soonest win</line>
<line globalnumber="117" number="116" form="verse">Applause; in generality, well fam&#8217;d,</line>
<line globalnumber="118" number="117" form="verse">If trim behavior, gestures mild, discreet</line>
<line globalnumber="119" number="118" form="verse">Endeavors, modest speech, beseeming mirth,</line>
<line globalnumber="120" number="119" form="verse">True friendship, active grace, persuasion sweet,</line>
<line globalnumber="121" number="120" form="verse">Delightful love innated from his birth,</line>
<line globalnumber="122" number="121" form="verse">Acquaintance unfamiliar, carriage just,</line>
<line globalnumber="123" number="122" form="verse">Offenseless resolution, wish&#8217;d sobriety,</line>
<line globalnumber="124" number="123" form="verse">Clean-temper&#8217;d moderation, steady trust,</line>
<line globalnumber="125" number="124" form="verse">Unburthen&#8217;d conscience, unfeign&#8217;d piety;</line>
<line globalnumber="126" number="125" form="verse">If these, or all of these, knit fast in one</line>
<line globalnumber="127" number="126" form="verse">Can merit praise, then justly may we say,</line>
<line globalnumber="128" number="127" form="verse">Not any from this frailer stage is gone</line>
<line globalnumber="129" number="128" form="verse">Whose name is like to live a longer day&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="130" number="129" form="verse">Though not in eminent courts or places great</line>
<line globalnumber="131" number="130" form="verse">For popular concourse, yet in that soil</line>
<line globalnumber="132" number="131" form="verse">Where he enjoy&#8217;d his birth, life, death, and seat</line>
<line globalnumber="133" number="132" form="verse">Which now sits mourning his untimely spoil. A</line>

<line globalnumber="135" number="134" form="verse">For private persons, in their private home,</line>
<line globalnumber="136" number="135" form="verse">As those descended from illustrious blood</line>
<line globalnumber="137" number="136" form="verse">In public view of greatness, whence they come.</line>
<line globalnumber="138" number="137" form="verse">Though I, rewarded with some sadder taste</line>
<line globalnumber="139" number="138" form="verse">Of knowing shame, by feeling it have prov&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="140" number="139" form="verse">My country&#8217;s thankless misconstruction cast</line>
<line globalnumber="141" number="140" form="verse">Upon my name and credit, both unlov&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="142" number="141" form="verse">By some whose fortunes, sunk into the wane</line>
<line globalnumber="143" number="142" form="verse">Of plenty and desert, have strove to win</line>
<line globalnumber="144" number="143" form="verse">Justice by wrong, and sifted to embane</line>
<line globalnumber="145" number="144" form="verse">My reputation with a witless sin;</line>
<line globalnumber="146" number="145" form="verse">Yet time, the father of unblushing truth,</line>
<line globalnumber="147" number="146" form="verse">May one day lay ope malice which hath cross&#8217;d it,</line>
<line globalnumber="148" number="147" form="verse">And right the hopes of my endangered youth,</line>
<line globalnumber="149" number="148" form="verse">Purchasing credit in the place I lost it.</line>
<line globalnumber="150" number="149" form="verse">Even in which place the subject of the verse</line>
<line globalnumber="151" number="150" form="verse">(Unhappy matter of a mourning style</line>
<line globalnumber="152" number="151" form="verse">Which now that subject&#8217;s merits doth rehearse)</line>
<line globalnumber="153" number="152" form="verse">Had education and new being; while</line>
<line globalnumber="154" number="153" form="verse">By fair demeanor he had won repute</line>
<line globalnumber="155" number="154" form="verse">Amongst the all of all that lived there,</line>
<line globalnumber="156" number="155" form="verse">For that his actions did so wholly suit</line>
<line globalnumber="157" number="156" form="verse">With worthiness, still memorable here.</line>
<line globalnumber="158" number="157" form="verse">The many hours till the day of doom</line>
<line globalnumber="159" number="158" form="verse">Will not consume his life and hapless end,</line>
<line globalnumber="160" number="159" form="verse">For should he lie obscur&#8217;d without a tomb,</line>
<line globalnumber="161" number="160" form="verse">Time would to time his honesty commend;</line>
<line globalnumber="162" number="161" form="verse">Whiles parents to their children will make known,</line>
<line globalnumber="163" number="162" form="verse">And they to their posterity impart,</line>
<line globalnumber="164" number="163" form="verse">How such a man was sadly overthrown</line>
<line globalnumber="165" number="164" form="verse">By a hand guided by a cruel heart,</line>
<line globalnumber="166" number="165" offset="2" form="verse">Whereof as many as shall hear that sadness</line>
<line globalnumber="167" number="166" offset="2" form="verse">Will blame the one&#8217;s hard fate, the other&#8217;s madness;</line>
<line globalnumber="168" number="167" form="verse">Whiles such as do recount that tale of woe,</line>
<line globalnumber="169" number="168" form="verse">Told by remembrance of the wisest heads,</line>
<line globalnumber="170" number="169" form="verse">Will in the end conclude the matter so,</line>
<line globalnumber="171" number="170" form="verse">As they will all go weeping to their beds.</line>
<line globalnumber="172" number="171" form="verse">For when the world lies winter&#8217;d in the storms</line>
<line globalnumber="173" number="172" form="verse">Of fearful consummation, and lays down</line>
<line globalnumber="174" number="173" form="verse">Th&#8217; unsteady change of his fantastic forms,</line>
<line globalnumber="175" number="174" form="verse">Expecting ever to be overthrown;</line>
<line globalnumber="176" number="175" form="verse">When the proud height of much affected sin</line>
<line globalnumber="177" number="176" form="verse">Shall ripen to a head, and in that pride</line>
<line globalnumber="178" number="177" form="verse">End in the miseries it did begin</line>
<line globalnumber="179" number="178" form="verse">And fall amidst the glory of his tide;</line>
<line globalnumber="180" number="179" form="verse">Then in a book where every work is writ</line>
<line globalnumber="181" number="180" form="verse">Shall this man&#8217;s actions be reveal&#8217;d, to show</line>
<line globalnumber="182" number="181" form="verse">The gainful fruit of well-employed wit,</line>
<line globalnumber="183" number="182" form="verse">Which paid to heaven the debt that it did owe.</line>
<line globalnumber="184" number="183" form="verse">Here shall be reckon&#8217;d up the constant faith,</line>
<line globalnumber="185" number="184" form="verse">Never untrue, where once he love profess&#8217;d;</line>
<line globalnumber="186" number="185" form="verse">Which is a miracle in men, one saith,</line>
<line globalnumber="187" number="186" form="verse">Long sought though rarely found, and he is best</line>
<line globalnumber="188" number="187" offset="2" form="verse">Who can make friendship, in those times of change,</line>
<line globalnumber="189" number="188" offset="2" form="verse">Admired more for being firm than strange.</line>
<line globalnumber="190" number="189" form="verse">When those weak houses of our brittle flesh</line>
<line globalnumber="191" number="190" form="verse">Shall ruin&#8217;d be by death, our grace and strength,</line>
<line globalnumber="192" number="191" form="verse">Youth, memory and shape that made us fresh</line>
<line globalnumber="193" number="192" form="verse">Cast down, and utterly decay&#8217;d at length;</line>
<line globalnumber="194" number="193" form="verse">When all shall turn to dust from whence we came</line>
<line globalnumber="195" number="194" form="verse">And we low-level&#8217;d in a narrow grave,</line>
<line globalnumber="196" number="195" form="verse">What can we leave behind us but a name,</line>
<line globalnumber="197" number="196" form="verse">Which, by a life well led, may honor have?</line>
<line globalnumber="198" number="197" form="verse">Such honor, O thou youth untimely lost,</line>
<line globalnumber="199" number="198" form="verse">Thou didst deserve and hast; for though thy soul</line>
<line globalnumber="200" number="199" form="verse">Hath took her flight to a diviner coast,</line>
<line globalnumber="201" number="200" form="verse">Yet here on earth thy fame lives ever whole,</line>
<line globalnumber="202" number="201" form="verse">In every heart seal&#8217;d up, in every tongue</line>
<line globalnumber="203" number="202" form="verse">Fit matter to discourse, no day prevented</line>
<line globalnumber="204" number="203" form="verse">That pities not thy sad and sudden wrong,</line>
<line globalnumber="205" number="204" form="verse">Of all alike beloved and lamented.</line>
<line globalnumber="206" number="205" form="verse">And I here to thy memorable worth,</line>
<line globalnumber="207" number="206" form="verse">In this last act of friendship, sacrifice</line>
<line globalnumber="208" number="207" form="verse">My love to thee, which I could not set forth</line>
<line globalnumber="209" number="208" form="verse">In any other habit of disguise.</line>
<line globalnumber="210" number="209" form="verse">Although I could not learn, whiles yet thou wert,</line>
<line globalnumber="211" number="210" form="verse">To speak the language of a servile breath,</line>
<line globalnumber="212" number="211" form="verse">My truth stole from my tongue into my heart,</line>
<line globalnumber="213" number="212" form="verse">Which shall not thence be sund&#8217;red, but in death.</line>
<line globalnumber="214" number="213" form="verse">And I confess my love was too remiss</line>
<line globalnumber="215" number="214" form="verse">That had not made thee know how much I priz&#8217;d thee,</line>
<line globalnumber="216" number="215" form="verse">But that mine error was, as yet it is,</line>
<line globalnumber="217" number="216" form="verse">To think love best in silence: for I siz&#8217;d thee</line>
<line globalnumber="218" number="217" form="verse">By what I would have been, not only ready</line>
<line globalnumber="219" number="218" form="verse">In telling I was thine, but being so,</line>
<line globalnumber="220" number="219" form="verse">By some effect to show it. He is steady</line>
<line globalnumber="221" number="220" form="verse">Who seems less than he is in open show.</line>
<line globalnumber="222" number="221" form="verse">Since then I still reserv&#8217;d to try the worst</line>
<line globalnumber="223" number="222" form="verse">Which hardest fate and time thus can lay on me.</line>
<line globalnumber="224" number="223" form="verse">T&#8217; enlarge my thoughts was hindered at first,</line>
<line globalnumber="225" number="224" form="verse">While thou hadst life; I took this task upon me,</line>
<line globalnumber="226" number="225" form="verse">To register with mine unhappy pen</line>
<line globalnumber="227" number="226" form="verse">Such duties as it owes to thy desert,</line>
<line globalnumber="228" number="227" form="verse">And set thee as a president to men,</line>
<line globalnumber="229" number="228" form="verse">And limn thee to the world but as thou wert&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="230" number="229" form="verse">Not hir&#8217;d, as heaven can witness in my soul,</line>
<line globalnumber="231" number="230" form="verse">By vain conceit, to please such ones as know it,</line>
<line globalnumber="232" number="231" form="verse">Nor servile to be lik&#8217;d, free from control,</line>
<line globalnumber="233" number="232" form="verse">Which, pain to many men, I do not owe it.</line>
<line globalnumber="234" number="233" form="verse">But here I trust I have discharged now</line>
<line globalnumber="235" number="234" form="verse">(Fair lovely branch too soon cut off) to thee,</line>
<line globalnumber="236" number="235" form="verse">My constant and irrefragable vow,</line>
<line globalnumber="237" number="236" form="verse">As, had it chanc&#8217;d, thou mightst have done to me&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="238" number="237" form="verse">But that no merit strong enough of mine</line>
<line globalnumber="239" number="238" form="verse">Had yielded store to thy well-abled quill</line>
<line globalnumber="240" number="239" form="verse">Whereby t&#8217;enroll my name, as this of thine,</line>

<line globalnumber="242" number="241" form="verse">Here, then, I offer up to memory</line>
<line globalnumber="243" number="242" form="verse">The value of my talent, precious man,</line>
<line globalnumber="244" number="243" form="verse">Whereby if thou live to posterity,</line>
<line globalnumber="245" number="244" form="verse">Though&#8217;t be not as I would, &#8217;tis as I can:</line>
<line globalnumber="246" number="245" offset="2" form="verse">In minds from whence endeavor doth proceed,</line>
<line globalnumber="247" number="246" offset="2" form="verse">A ready will is taken for the deed.</line>
<line globalnumber="248" number="247" form="verse">Yet ere I take my longest last farewell</line>
<line globalnumber="249" number="248" form="verse">From thee, fair mark of sorrow, let me frame</line>
<line globalnumber="250" number="249" form="verse">Some ampler work of thank, wherein to tell</line>
<line globalnumber="251" number="250" form="verse">What more thou didst deserve than in thy name,</line>
<line globalnumber="252" number="251" form="verse">And free thee from the scandal of such senses</line>
<line globalnumber="253" number="252" form="verse">As in the rancor of unhappy spleen</line>
<line globalnumber="254" number="253" form="verse">Measure thy course of life, with false pretenses</line>
<line globalnumber="255" number="254" form="verse">Comparing by thy death what thou hast been.</line>
<line globalnumber="256" number="255" offset="2" form="verse">So in his mischiefs is the world accurs&#8217;d:</line>
<line globalnumber="257" number="256" offset="2" form="verse">It picks out matter to inform the worst.</line>
<line globalnumber="258" number="257" form="verse">The willful blindness that hoodwinks the eyes</line>
<line globalnumber="259" number="258" form="verse">Of men enwrapped in an earthy veil</line>
<line globalnumber="260" number="259" form="verse">Makes them most ignorantly exercise</line>
<line globalnumber="261" number="260" form="verse">And yield to humor when it doth assail,</line>
<line globalnumber="262" number="261" form="verse">Whereby the candle and the body&#8217;s light</line>
<line globalnumber="263" number="262" form="verse">Darkens the inward eyesight of the mind,</line>
<line globalnumber="264" number="263" form="verse">Presuming still it sees, even in the night</line>
<line globalnumber="265" number="264" form="verse">Of that same ignorance which makes them blind.</line>
<line globalnumber="266" number="265" form="verse">Hence conster they with corrupt commentaries,</line>
<line globalnumber="267" number="266" form="verse">Proceeding from a nature as corrupt,</line>
<line globalnumber="268" number="267" form="verse">The text of malice, which so often varies</line>
<line globalnumber="269" number="268" form="verse">As &#8217;tis by seeming reason underpropp&#8217;d.</line>
<line globalnumber="270" number="269" form="verse">O, whither tends the lamentable spite</line>
<line globalnumber="271" number="270" form="verse">Of this world&#8217;s teenful apprehension,</line>
<line globalnumber="272" number="271" form="verse">Which understands all things amiss, whose light</line>
<line globalnumber="273" number="272" form="verse">Shines not amidst the dark of their dissension?</line>
<line globalnumber="274" number="273" form="verse">True &#8217;tis, this man, whiles yet he was a man,</line>
<line globalnumber="275" number="274" form="verse">Sooth&#8217;d not the current of besotted fashion,</line>
<line globalnumber="276" number="275" form="verse">Nor could digest, as some loose mimics can,</line>
<line globalnumber="277" number="276" form="verse">An empty sound of overweening passion,</line>
<line globalnumber="278" number="277" form="verse">So much to be made servant to the base</line>
<line globalnumber="279" number="278" form="verse">And sensual aptness of disunion&#8217;d vices,</line>
<line globalnumber="280" number="279" form="verse">To purchase commendation by disgrace,</line>
<line globalnumber="281" number="280" form="verse">Whereto the world and heat of sin entices.</line>
<line globalnumber="282" number="281" form="verse">But in a safer contemplation,</line>
<line globalnumber="283" number="282" form="verse">Secure in what he knew, he ever chose</line>
<line globalnumber="284" number="283" form="verse">The ready way to commendation,</line>
<line globalnumber="285" number="284" form="verse">By shunning all invitements strange, of those</line>
<line globalnumber="286" number="285" form="verse">Whose illness is, the necessary praise</line>
<line globalnumber="287" number="286" form="verse">Must wait upon their actions; only rare</line>
<line globalnumber="288" number="287" form="verse">In being rare in shame (which strives to raise</line>
<line globalnumber="289" number="288" form="verse">Their name by doing what they do not care),</line>
<line globalnumber="290" number="289" form="verse">As if the free commission of their ill</line>
<line globalnumber="291" number="290" form="verse">Were even as boundless as their prompt desires;</line>
<line globalnumber="292" number="291" form="verse">Only like lords, like subjects to their will,</line>
<line globalnumber="293" number="292" form="verse">Which their fond dotage ever more admires.</line>
<line globalnumber="294" number="293" form="verse">He was not so: but in a serious awe,</line>
<line globalnumber="295" number="294" form="verse">Ruling the little ordered commonwealth</line>
<line globalnumber="296" number="295" form="verse">Of his own self, with honor to the law</line>
<line globalnumber="297" number="296" form="verse">That gave peace to his bread, bread to his health;</line>
<line globalnumber="298" number="297" form="verse">Which ever he maintain&#8217;d in sweet content</line>
<line globalnumber="299" number="298" form="verse">And pleasurable rest, wherein he joy&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="300" number="299" form="verse">A monarchy of comfort&#8217;s government,</line>
<line globalnumber="301" number="300" form="verse">Never until his last to be destroy&#8217;d.</line>
<line globalnumber="302" number="301" form="verse">For in the Vineyard of heaven-favored learning</line>
<line globalnumber="303" number="302" form="verse">Where he was double-honor&#8217;d in degree,</line>
<line globalnumber="304" number="303" form="verse">His observation and discreet discerning</line>
<line globalnumber="305" number="304" form="verse">Had taught him in both fortunes to be free;</line>
<line globalnumber="306" number="305" form="verse">Whence now retir&#8217;d home, to a home indeed</line>
<line globalnumber="307" number="306" form="verse">The home of his condition and estate,</line>
<line globalnumber="308" number="307" form="verse">He well provided &#8217;gainst the hand of need,</line>
<line globalnumber="309" number="308" form="verse">Whence young men sometime grow unfortunate;</line>
<line globalnumber="310" number="309" form="verse">His disposition, by the bonds of unity,</line>
<line globalnumber="311" number="310" form="verse">So fast&#8217;ned to his reason that it strove</line>
<line globalnumber="312" number="311" form="verse">With understanding&#8217;s grave immunity</line>
<line globalnumber="313" number="312" form="verse">To purchase from all hearts a steady love;</line>
<line globalnumber="314" number="313" form="verse">Wherein not any one thing comprehends</line>
<line globalnumber="315" number="314" form="verse">Proportionable note of what he was,</line>
<line globalnumber="316" number="315" form="verse">Than that he was so constant to his friends</line>
<line globalnumber="317" number="316" form="verse">As he would no occasion overpass</line>
<line globalnumber="318" number="317" form="verse">Which might make known his unaffected care,</line>
<line globalnumber="319" number="318" form="verse">In all respects of trial, to unlock</line>
<line globalnumber="320" number="319" form="verse">His bosom and his store, which did declare</line>
<line globalnumber="321" number="320" form="verse">That Christ was his, and he was Friendship&#8217;s Rock:</line>
<line globalnumber="322" number="321" form="verse">A Rock of Friendship figured in his name,</line>
<line globalnumber="323" number="322" form="verse">Fore-shewing what he was, and what should be,</line>
<line globalnumber="324" number="323" form="verse">Most true presage; and he discharg&#8217;d the same</line>
<line globalnumber="325" number="324" form="verse">In every act of perfect amity&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="326" number="325" form="verse">Though in the complemental phrase of words</line>
<line globalnumber="327" number="326" form="verse">He never was addicted to the vain</line>
<line globalnumber="328" number="327" form="verse">Of boast, such as the common breath affords;</line>
<line globalnumber="329" number="328" form="verse">He was in use most fast, in tongue most plain,</line>
<line globalnumber="330" number="329" form="verse">Nor amongst all those virtues that forever</line>
<line globalnumber="331" number="330" form="verse">Adorn&#8217;d his reputation will be found</line>
<line globalnumber="332" number="331" form="verse">One greater than his Faith, which did persever,</line>
<line globalnumber="333" number="332" form="verse">Where once it was protested, alway sound.</line>
<line globalnumber="334" number="333" form="verse">Hence sprung the deadly fuel that reviv&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="335" number="334" form="verse">The rage which wrought his end, for had he been</line>
<line globalnumber="336" number="335" form="verse">Slacker in love, he had been longer liv&#8217;d</line>

<line globalnumber="339" number="338" form="verse">Gave death for free good will, and wounds for love.</line>
<line globalnumber="340" number="339" form="verse">Pity it was that blood had not been priz&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="341" number="340" form="verse">At higher rate, and reason set above</line>
<line globalnumber="342" number="341" form="verse">Most unjust choler, which untimely</line>

<line globalnumber="344" number="343" form="verse">Robb&#8217;d virtue of a follower so true</line>

<line globalnumber="351" number="350" form="verse">For men whose pure simplicity hath drawn</line>
<line globalnumber="352" number="351" form="verse">Their trust to be betray&#8217;d by being caught</line>
<line globalnumber="353" number="352" form="verse">Within the snares of making truth a pawn;</line>
<line globalnumber="354" number="353" form="verse">Whiles it, not doubting whereinto it enters,</line>
<line globalnumber="355" number="354" form="verse">Without true proof and knowledge of a friend,</line>
<line globalnumber="356" number="355" form="verse">Sincere in singleness of heart, adventers</line>
<line globalnumber="357" number="356" form="verse">To give fit cause, ere love begin to end:</line>
<line globalnumber="358" number="357" offset="2" form="verse">His unfeign&#8217;d friendship where it least was sought,</line>
<line globalnumber="359" number="358" offset="2" form="verse">Him to a fatal timeless ruin brought;</line>
<line globalnumber="360" number="359" form="verse">Whereby the life that purity adorn&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="361" number="360" form="verse">With real merit, by this sudden end</line>
<line globalnumber="362" number="361" form="verse">Is in the mouth of some in manner scorn&#8217;d,</line>
<line globalnumber="363" number="362" form="verse">Made questionable, for they do intend,</line>
<line globalnumber="364" number="363" form="verse">According to the tenor of the saw</line>
<line globalnumber="365" number="364" form="verse">Mistook, if not observ&#8217;d (writ long ago</line>

<line globalnumber="367" number="366" form="verse">That "Such as is the end, the life proves so."</line>
<line globalnumber="368" number="367" form="verse">Thus he, who to the universal lapse</line>
<line globalnumber="369" number="368" form="verse">Gave sweet redemption, off&#8217;ring up his blood</line>
<line globalnumber="370" number="369" form="verse">To conquer death by death, and loose the traps</line>
<line globalnumber="371" number="370" form="verse">Of hell, even in the triumph that it stood:</line>
<line globalnumber="372" number="371" form="verse">He thus, for that his guiltless life was spilt</line>
<line globalnumber="373" number="372" form="verse">By death, which was made subject to the curse,</line>
<line globalnumber="374" number="373" form="verse">Might in like manner be reprov&#8217;d of guilt</line>
<line globalnumber="375" number="374" form="verse">In his pure life, for that his end was worse.</line>
<line globalnumber="376" number="375" form="verse">But O far be it, our unholy lips</line>
<line globalnumber="377" number="376" form="verse">Should so profane the deity above</line>
<line globalnumber="378" number="377" form="verse">As thereby to ordain revenging whips</line>

<line globalnumber="380" number="379" form="verse">The hand that lends us honor in our days</line>
<line globalnumber="381" number="380" form="verse">May shorten when it please, and justly take</line>

<line globalnumber="383" number="382" form="verse">As best becomes that wisdom did us make.</line>
<line globalnumber="384" number="383" form="verse">The second brother, who was next begot</line>
<line globalnumber="385" number="384" form="verse">Of all that ever were begotten yet,</line>
<line globalnumber="386" number="385" form="verse">Was by a hand in vengeance rude and hot</line>

<line globalnumber="469" number="468" form="verse">With all what men in eminence possess,</line>
<line globalnumber="470" number="469" form="verse">Are, without ornaments to praise them, vile:</line>
<line globalnumber="471" number="470" form="verse">The beauty of the mind is nobleness.</line>
<line globalnumber="472" number="471" form="verse">And such as have that beauty, well deserve</line>
<line globalnumber="473" number="472" form="verse">Eternal characters, that after death</line>
<line globalnumber="474" number="473" form="verse">Remembrance of their worth we may preserve,</line>
<line globalnumber="475" number="474" form="verse">So that their glory die not with their breath.</line>
<line globalnumber="476" number="475" form="verse">Else what avails it in a goodly strife</line>
<line globalnumber="477" number="476" form="verse">Upon this face of earth here to contend,</line>
<line globalnumber="478" number="477" form="verse">The good t&#8217;exceed the wicked in their life,</line>
<line globalnumber="479" number="478" form="verse">Should both be like obscured in their end?</line>
<line globalnumber="480" number="479" form="verse">Until which end, there is none rightly can</line>
<line globalnumber="481" number="480" form="verse">Be termed happy, since the happiness</line>
<line globalnumber="482" number="481" form="verse">Depends upon the goodness of the man,</line>
<line globalnumber="483" number="482" form="verse">Which afterwards his praises will express.</line>
<line globalnumber="484" number="483" form="verse">Look hither then, you that enjoy the youth</line>
<line globalnumber="485" number="484" form="verse">Of your best days, and see how unexpected</line>
<line globalnumber="486" number="485" form="verse">Death can betray your jollity to ruth</line>
<line globalnumber="487" number="486" form="verse">When death you think is least to be respected!</line>
<line globalnumber="488" number="487" form="verse">The person of this model here set out</line>
<line globalnumber="489" number="488" form="verse">Had all that youth and happy days could give him,</line>
<line globalnumber="490" number="489" form="verse">Yet could not all-encompass him about</line>
<line globalnumber="491" number="490" form="verse">Against th&#8217;assault of death, who to relieve him</line>
<line globalnumber="492" number="491" form="verse">Struck home but to the frail and mortal parts</line>
<line globalnumber="493" number="492" form="verse">Of his humanity, but could not touch</line>
<line globalnumber="494" number="493" form="verse">His flourishing and fair long-liv&#8217;d deserts,</line>
<line globalnumber="495" number="494" form="verse">Above fate&#8217;s reach, his singleness was such&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="496" number="495" form="verse">So that he dies but once, but doubly lives,</line>
<line globalnumber="497" number="496" form="verse">Once in his proper self, then in his name;</line>
<line globalnumber="498" number="497" form="verse">Predestinated Time, who all deprives,</line>
<line globalnumber="499" number="498" form="verse">Could never yet deprive him of the same.</line>
<line globalnumber="500" number="499" form="verse">And had the Genius which attended on him</line>
<line globalnumber="501" number="500" form="verse">Been possibilited to keep him safe</line>
<line globalnumber="502" number="501" form="verse">Against the rigor that hath overgone him,</line>
<line globalnumber="503" number="502" form="verse">He had been to the public use a staff,</line>
<line globalnumber="504" number="503" form="verse">Leading by his example in the path</line>
<line globalnumber="505" number="504" form="verse">Which guides to doing well, wherein so few</line>
<line globalnumber="506" number="505" form="verse">The proneness of this age to error hath</line>
<line globalnumber="507" number="506" form="verse">Informed rightly in the courses true.</line>
<line globalnumber="508" number="507" form="verse">As then the loss of one, whose inclination</line>
<line globalnumber="509" number="508" form="verse">Strove to win love in general, is sad,</line>
<line globalnumber="510" number="509" form="verse">So specially his friends, in soft compassion</line>
<line globalnumber="511" number="510" form="verse">Do feel the greatest loss they could have had.</line>
<line globalnumber="512" number="511" form="verse">Amongst them all, she who those nine of years</line>
<line globalnumber="513" number="512" form="verse">Liv&#8217;d fellow to his counsels and his bed</line>
<line globalnumber="514" number="513" form="verse">Hath the most share in loss: for I in hers</line>
<line globalnumber="515" number="514" form="verse">Feel what distemperature this chance hath bred.</line>
<line globalnumber="516" number="515" form="verse">The chaste embracements of conjugal love,</line>
<line globalnumber="517" number="516" form="verse">Who in a mutual harmony consent,</line>
<line globalnumber="518" number="517" form="verse">Are so impatient of a strange remove</line>
<line globalnumber="519" number="518" form="verse">As meager death itself seems to lament,</line>
<line globalnumber="520" number="519" form="verse">And weep upon those cheeks which nature fram&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="521" number="520" form="verse">To be delightful orbs in whom the force</line>
<line globalnumber="522" number="521" form="verse">Of lively sweetness plays, so that asham&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="523" number="522" form="verse">Death often pities his unkind divorce.</line>
<line globalnumber="524" number="523" form="verse">Such was the separation here constrain&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="525" number="524" form="verse">(Well-worthy to be termed a rudeness rather),</line>
<line globalnumber="526" number="525" form="verse">For in his life his love was so unfeign&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="527" number="526" form="verse">As he was both an husband and a father&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="528" number="527" form="verse">The one in firm affection and the other</line>
<line globalnumber="529" number="528" form="verse">In careful providence, which ever strove</line>
<line globalnumber="530" number="529" form="verse">With joint assistance to grace one another</line>
<line globalnumber="531" number="530" form="verse">With every helpful furtherance of love.</line>
<line globalnumber="532" number="531" form="verse">But since the sum of all that can be said</line>
<line globalnumber="533" number="532" form="verse">Can be but said that "He was good"</line>
<line globalnumber="534" number="533" form="verse">(which wholly Includes all excellence can be display&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="535" number="534" form="verse">In praise of virtue and reproach of folly).</line>
<line globalnumber="536" number="535" offset="2" form="verse">His due deserts, this sentence on him gives,</line>
<line globalnumber="537" number="536" offset="2" form="verse">"He died in life, yet in his death he lives."</line>
<line globalnumber="538" number="537" form="verse">Now runs the method of this doleful song</line>
<line globalnumber="539" number="538" form="verse">In accents brief to thee, O thou deceas&#8217;d!</line>
<line globalnumber="540" number="539" form="verse">To whom those pains do only all belong</line>
<line globalnumber="541" number="540" form="verse">As witnesses I did not love thee least.</line>
<line globalnumber="542" number="541" form="verse">For could my worthless brain find out but how</line>
<line globalnumber="543" number="542" form="verse">To raise thee from the sepulcher of dust,</line>
<line globalnumber="544" number="543" form="verse">Undoubtedly thou shouldst have partage now</line>
<line globalnumber="545" number="544" form="verse">Of life with me, and heaven be counted just</line>
<line globalnumber="546" number="545" form="verse">If to a supplicating soul it would</line>
<line globalnumber="547" number="546" form="verse">Give life anew, by giving life again</line>
<line globalnumber="548" number="547" form="verse">Where life is miss&#8217;d; whereby discomfort should</line>
<line globalnumber="549" number="548" form="verse">Right his old griefs, and former joys retain</line>
<line globalnumber="550" number="549" form="verse">Which now with thee are leap&#8217;d into thy tomb</line>
<line globalnumber="551" number="550" form="verse">And buried in that hollow vault of woe,</line>
<line globalnumber="552" number="551" form="verse">Expecting yet a more severer doom</line>
<line globalnumber="553" number="552" form="verse">Than time&#8217;s strict flinty hand will let &#8217;em know.</line>
<line globalnumber="554" number="553" form="verse">And now if I have level&#8217;d mine account</line>
<line globalnumber="555" number="554" form="verse">And reckon&#8217;d up in a true measured score</line>
<line globalnumber="556" number="555" form="verse">Those perfect graces which were ever wont</line>
<line globalnumber="557" number="556" form="verse">To wait on thee alive, I ask no more</line>
<line globalnumber="558" number="557" form="verse">(But shall hereafter in a poor content</line>
<line globalnumber="559" number="558" form="verse">Immure those imputations I sustain,</line>
<line globalnumber="560" number="559" form="verse">Learning my days of youth so to prevent</line>
<line globalnumber="561" number="560" form="verse">As not to be cast down by them again)&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="562" number="561" form="verse">Only those hopes which fate denies to grant</line>
<line globalnumber="563" number="562" form="verse">In full possession to a captive heart</line>
<line globalnumber="564" number="563" form="verse">Who, if it were in plenty, still would want</line>
<line globalnumber="565" number="564" form="verse">Before it may enjoy his better part;</line>
<line globalnumber="566" number="565" form="verse">From which detain&#8217;d, and banish&#8217;d in th&#8217; exile</line>
<line globalnumber="567" number="566" form="verse">Of dim misfortune, has none other prop</line>
<line globalnumber="568" number="567" form="verse">Whereon to lean and rest itself the while</line>
<line globalnumber="569" number="568" form="verse">But the weak comfort of the hapless, Hope.</line>
<line globalnumber="570" number="569" form="verse">And Hope must in despite of fearful change</line>
<line globalnumber="571" number="570" form="verse">Play in the strongest closet of my breast,</line>
<line globalnumber="572" number="571" form="verse">Although perhaps I ignorantly range</line>
<line globalnumber="573" number="572" form="verse">And court opinion in my deep&#8217;st unrest.</line>
<line globalnumber="574" number="573" form="verse">But whether doth the stream of my mischance</line>
<line globalnumber="575" number="574" form="verse">Drive me beyond myself, fast friend, soon lost,</line>
<line globalnumber="576" number="575" form="verse">Long may thy worthiness thy name advance</line>
<line globalnumber="577" number="576" form="verse">Amongst the virtuous and deserving most,</line>
<line globalnumber="578" number="577" offset="2" form="verse">Who herein hast forever happy prov&#8217;d:</line>
<line globalnumber="579" number="578" offset="2" form="verse">In life thou liv&#8217;dst, in death thou died&#8217;st belov&#8217;d.</line>
