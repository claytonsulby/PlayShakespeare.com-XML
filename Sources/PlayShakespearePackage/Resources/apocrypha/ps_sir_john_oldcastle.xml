<line globalnumber="794" number="8" form="verse">This Lionel, Duke of Clarence, as I said,</line>
<line globalnumber="795" number="9" form="verse">Third son of Edward (England&#8217;s King) the third,</line>
<line globalnumber="796" number="10" form="verse">Had issue Phillip, his sole daughter and heir;</line>
<line globalnumber="797" number="11" form="verse">Which Phillip afterward was given in marriage</line>
<line globalnumber="798" number="12" form="verse">To Edmund Mortimer, the Earl of March,</line>
<line globalnumber="799" number="13" form="verse">And by him had a son called Roger Mortimer;</line>

<line globalnumber="802" number="16" form="verse">Two daughters and two sons&#8212;but those three</line>

<line globalnumber="804" number="18" form="verse">And now was left her father&#8217;s only heir,</line>
<line globalnumber="805" number="19" form="verse">My fortune was to marry, being too</line>
<line globalnumber="806" number="20" form="verse">By my grandfather of Kind Edward&#8217;s line:</line>
<line globalnumber="807" number="21" form="verse">So of his sirname, I am called, you know,</line>

<line globalnumber="816" number="30" form="verse">Harry the first, as plainly doth appear,</line>
<line globalnumber="817" number="31" form="verse">Are false intruders and usurp the Crown.</line>
<line globalnumber="818" number="32" form="verse">For when young Richard was at Pomfret slain,</line>
<line globalnumber="819" number="33" form="verse">In him the title of prince Edward died,</line>
<line globalnumber="820" number="34" form="verse">That was the eldest of king Edward&#8217;s sons:</line>

<line globalnumber="822" number="36" form="verse">Death in his nonage had before bereft:</line>
<line globalnumber="823" number="37" form="verse">So that my wife, derived from Lionel,</line>
<line globalnumber="824" number="38" form="verse">Third son unto king Edward, ought proceed,</line>
<line globalnumber="825" number="39" form="verse">And take possession of the Diadem</line>
