Nay, did not the learned parson, Master Pigman, tell us e&#8217;en now that all flesh is frail, we are born to die, man has but a time, with such-like deep and profound persuasions, as he is a rare fellow, you know, and an excellent reader. And for example, as there are examples abundance, did not Sir Humphrey Bubble die t&#8217;other day? There&#8217;s a lusty widow! Why, she cry&#8217;d not above half an hour! For shame, for shame!

Now keys are your only guns, key-guns, key-guns, and bawds the gunners. Who are your sentinels in peace and stand ready charg&#8217;d to give warning with hems, hums, and pocky coughs?

<line globalnumber="62" number="5" form="prose">Troth, and for mine own part, I am a poor gentleman and a scholar. I have been matriculated in the university, wore out six gowns there, seen some fools and some scholars, some of the city and some of the country, kept order, went bare-headed over the quadrangle, eat my commons with a good stomach, and battled with discretion; at last, having done many sleights and tricks to maintain my wit in use, as my brain would never endure me to be idle, I was expell&#8217;d the university only for stealing a cheese out of Jesus College.</line>

<speaker long="George Pyeboard">PYE.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="64" number="7" form="prose">Oh, there was one Welshman, God forgive him, pursued it hard, and never left till I turn&#8217;d my staff toward London, where when I came, all my friends were pit-hol&#8217;d, gone to graves, as indeed there was but a few left before. Then was I turn&#8217;d to my wits to shift in the world, to tower among sons and heirs, and fools, and gulls, and ladies&#8217; eldest sons, to work upon nothing, to feed out of flint; and ever since has my belly been much beholden to my brain. But now to return to you, old Skirmish: I say as you say, and for my part wish a turbulency in the world, for I have nothing to lose but my wits, and I think they are as mad as they will be; and to strengthen your argument the more, I say an honest war is better than a bawdy peace, as touching my profession. The multiplicity of scholars, hatch&#8217;d and nourish&#8217;d in the idle claws of peace, makes &#8217;em, like fishes, one devour another, and the community of learning has so play&#8217;d upon affections, and thereby almost religion is come about to fantasy, and discredited by being too much spoken of, in so many and mean mouths. I myself being a scholar and a graduate have no other comfort by my learning but the affection of my words, to know how, scholar-like, to name what I want, and can call myself a beggar both in Greek and Latin. And therefore not to cog with peace, I&#8217;ll not be afraid to say &#8217;tis a great breeder but a barren nourisher, a great getter of children which must either be thieves or rich men, knaves or beggars.</line>

Thou mayst be a knave when thou wilt, and peace is good madam to all other professions, and an arrant drab to us. Let us handle her accordingly, and by our wits thrive in despite of her, for since the law lives by quarrels, the courtier by smooth good-morrows, and every profession makes itself great by imperfections, why not we then by shifts, wiles, and forgeries? And seeing our brains are our only patrimonies, let&#8217;s spend with judgment, not like a desperate son and heir, but like a sober and discreet Templar, one that will never march beyond the bounds of his allowance. And for our thriving means, thus: I myself will put on the deceit of a fortune-teller.</line>

Why, all women know &#8217;tis as honorable a thing as to lie with a man, and I, to spite my sister&#8217;s vow the more, have entertained a suitor already, a fine gallant knight of the last feather. He says he will coach me too, and well appoint me, allow me money to dice withal, and many such pleasing protestations he sticks upon my lips. Indeed, his short-winded father i&#8217; th&#8217; country is wondrous wealthy, a most abominable farmer, and therefore he may do it in time. Troth, I&#8217;ll venture upon him. Women are not without ways enow to help themselves: if he prove wise and good as his word, why, I shall love him and use him kindly; and if he prove an ass, why, in a quarter of an hour&#8217;s warning I can transform him into an ox: there comes in my relief again.</line>

And to confirm my former presage to the widow, I have advis&#8217;d old Peter Skirmish the soldier to hurt Corporal Oath upon the leg, and in that hurry I&#8217;ll rush amongst &#8217;em, and instead of giving the corporal some cordial to comfort him, I&#8217;ll pour into his mouth a potion of a sleepy nature to make him seem as dead; for the which the old soldier being apprehended and ready to be borne to execution, I&#8217;ll step in and take upon me the cure of the dead man upon pain of dying the condemned&#8217;s death. The corporal will wake at his minute, when the sleepy force hath wrought itself, and so shall I get myself into a most admir&#8217;d opinion, and, under the pretext of that cunning, beguile as I see occasion. And if that foolish Nicholas St. Tantlings keep true time with the chain, my plot will be sound, the captain delivered, and my wits applauded among scholars and soldiers forever.</line>

They, greedy at this word, and hoping to make purchase of me, offered their attendance to go along with me. My hap was to make bold with your door, sir, which my thoughts show&#8217;d me the most fairest and comfortablest entrance, and I hope I have happened right upon understanding and pity. May it please your good worship then but to uphold my device, which is to let one of your men put me out at a back door, and I shall be bound to your worship forever.</line>

For it is the property of all you that are widows, a handful excepted, to hate those that honestly and carefully love you, to the maintenance of credit, state, and posterity, and strongly to dote on those that only love you to undo you. Who regard you least are best regarded; who hate you most are best beloved. And if there be but one man amongst ten thousand millions of men that is accurst, disastrous, and evilly planeted, whom Fortune beats most, whom God hates most, and all societies esteem least, that man is sure to be a husband. Such is the peevish moon that rules your bloods. An impudent fellow best woos you, a flattering lip best wins you, or in a mirth, who talks rougliest is most sweetest; nor can you distinguish truth from forgeries, mists from simplicity: witness those two deceitful monsters that you have entertain&#8217;d for bridegrooms.</line>
