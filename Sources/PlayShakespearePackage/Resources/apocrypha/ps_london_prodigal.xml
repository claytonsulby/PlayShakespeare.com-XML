<line globalnumber="4" number="4" form="verse">I leaving you his patron and his guide?</line>
</speech>

<line globalnumber="5" number="5" form="verse">I&#8217;faith, brother, so as you will grieve to hear,</line>
<line globalnumber="6" number="6" form="verse">And I almost ashamed to report it.</line>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker long="Old Flowerdale">OLD. FLOW.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="7" number="7" form="prose">Why, how is&#8217;t, brother? What doth he spend beyond the allowance I left him?</line>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker long="Uncle Flowerdale">UNCLE.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="8" number="8" form="prose">How! Beyond that and far more: why, your exhibition is nothing. He hath spent that, and since hath borrowed, protested with oaths, alleged kindred to wring money from me, by the love I bore his father, by the fortunes might fall upon himself, to furnish his wants. That done, I have had since his bond, his friend, and friend&#8217;s bond although I know that he spends is yours, yet it grieves me to see the unbridled wildness that reigns over him.</line>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker long="Old Flowerdale">OLD. FLOW.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="9" number="9" form="prose">Brother, what is the manner of his life? How is the name of his offenses? If they do not relish altogether of damnation, his youth may privilege his wantonness: I myself ran an unbridled course till thirty, nay almost till forty; well, you see how I am: for vice once looked into with the eyes of discretion, and well balanced with the weights of reason, the course past seems so abominable that the landlord of himself, which is the heart of his body, will rather entomb himself in the earth, or seek a new tenant to remain in him, which once settled, how much better are they that in their youth have known all these vices and left it, than those that knew little and in their age runs into it? Believe me, brother, they that die most virtuous hath in their youth lived most vicious, and none knows the danger of the fire more than he that falls into it. But say, how is the course of his life? Letâ€™s hear his particulars.</line>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker long="Uncle Flowerdale">UNCLE.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="10" number="10" form="prose">Why, I&#8217;ll tell you, brother. He is a continual swearer, and a breaker of his oaths, which is bad.</line>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker long="Old Flowerdale">OLD. FLOW.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="11" number="11" form="prose">I grant indeed to swear is bad, but not keeping those oaths is better, for who will set by a bad thing? Nay, by my faith, I hold this rather a virtue than a vice. Well, I pray, proceed.</line>

</speech>

<speaker long="Old Flowerdale">OLD. FLOW.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="13" number="13" form="prose">By my faith, this is none of the worst neither, for if he brawl and be beaten for it, it will in time make him shun it: for what brings man or child more to virtue than correction? What reigns over him else?</line>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker long="Uncle Flowerdale">UNCLE.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="14" number="14" form="prose">He is a great drinker, and one that will forget himself.</line>
</speech>

<speaker long="Old Flowerdale">OLD. FLOW.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="15" number="15" form="verse">O, best of all, vice should be forgotten:</line>
<line globalnumber="16" number="16" form="verse">Let him drink on, so he drink not churches.</line>
<line globalnumber="17" number="17" form="verse">Nay, an this be the worst, I hold it rather a happiness in him</line>
<line globalnumber="18" number="18" form="verse">Than any iniquity. Hath he any more attendants?</line>
